### Core Technologies Used:
- Tone.js
- Mongo DB
- Express.Js
- React 
- Node.Js
- HTML 
- CSS

### Additional Libraries / Frameworks:
- Materialize-React for styling
- Bcrypt & JSON Webtokens for authentication / authorization
- Mongoose for DB management
- Tone.js for consistent event timing / audio scheduling, groovy playback methods.  See this great article: ![A Tale of Two Clocks](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)
- webmidi API for handling MIDI output devices / sending MIDI messages
---

### Future Enhancements: 
- I'd still like to get WebMidi cooking in this app... Building in a sprint, I found myself in a place facing a fork in the road development-wise; pursue midi functionality or experiment tone.js.  I chose to work with tone - it's amazing!

### Unsolved Problems: 
- Tone's initial buffereing can be a bit strange when loading larger files / samples.  setTimeout is helping here for the time being.  I'd like to work in a slicker implementation.
