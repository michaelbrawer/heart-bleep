This project owe's an enormous debt of gratitude to [Pierlo-Upitup's Polyrhythmical](https://github.com/pierlo-upitup/polyrhythmical/blob/master/src/components/StepSequencer.js), as well as [Kirie's excellent TR808 project](https://github.com/kirie/StepSequencer) (not to mention [the 808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808) itself...  Studying (and borrowing liberally from) from these projects really helped me understand how tools I've long used in the recording studio (step sequencers) might be implemented programatically.  Huge Thanks to my 
GA instructors [Jim Clark](https://github.com/jim-clark) and [Jonathan Tamsut](https://github.com/jtamsut) for their incredibly capable piloting of our WDI cohort's ship, and for never once throwing something at me out of frustration.

(Even through I likely deserved it...  406 Error Forever!)
